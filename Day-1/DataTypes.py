#Basic data types in pyhton
#-------------------------------

string = 'text'
str_number = 'number'
num_int = 10
num_float = 0.1
boolean = True
none_type = None


print(type(num_int))
print(type(str_number))
print(type(num_float))
print(type(boolean))
print(type(none_type))


#Simple Exercise
#-------------------------------

user = 'student'
app =  'python'
print(type(user))
print(type(app))

print(f"Once there was a curious {user} who wanted to become an AI expert.")
print(f"Every night, they practiced {app} until the laptop begged for rest.")
print(f"One day, they discovered a bug so strange even StackOverflow got confused.")
print(f"After hours of struggle, the student finally fixed it with a single missing comma.")
print(f"That moment, they realized debugging is just detective work with extra pain.")
print(f"And from that day, they coded smarter, not harder—legend in the making.")

#string formatting

print(f'My name is: {user}')

#refactoring to day -1 directory
print(f'My age is: {app}')
