## 🧐 About the Project

This repository is a structured, beginner‑friendly to advanced learning path for Python that focuses on real-world coding, clean patterns, and production‑oriented practices. It is ideal for learners who want a single, well‑organized place to go from writing their first script to building complete, maintainable applications.

### ✨ Key Highlights

- **Progressive Learning Path** – Topics are ordered from fundamentals to advanced concepts.
- **Well‑Commented Codebase** – Scripts include explanations to clarify “why” not just “what”.
- **Real‑World Use Cases** – Examples map to practical scenarios and common developer tasks.
- **Pythonic & Clean Code** – Emphasis on readability, PEP 8, and good software engineering habits.

## 📚 Curriculum

### 1️⃣ Fundamentals

- Python setup, running scripts, basic syntax
- Variables, data types, type casting
- Strings and formatting
- Basic input/output and simple programs

**Goal:** Get comfortable writing and running simple Python scripts.

---

### 2️⃣ Control Flow

- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- `for` and `while` loops
- `break`, `continue`, `pass`
- Pattern‑style problems using loops

**Goal:** Learn to control program logic and repetition.

---

### 3️⃣ Data Structures

- Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- Common methods and operations
- Slicing, unpacking, comprehensions
- When to use which data structure

**Goal:** Use the right structure for the right problem efficiently.

---

### 4️⃣ Functions & Modules

- Defining and calling functions
- Parameters & return values, `*args`, `**kwargs`
- Lambda functions and higher‑order functions
- Modules, packages, and imports

**Goal:** Write reusable, modular, and organized code.

---

### 5️⃣ File Handling

- Reading and writing text files
- Working with CSV and JSON
- Context managers (`with` statement)
- Basic filesystem operations

**Goal:** Build scripts that interact reliably with files and data.

---

### 6️⃣ Exception Handling

- `try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`
- Catching specific exceptions
- Raising and creating custom exceptions
- Basic logging instead of silent failures

**Goal:** Make programs robust and fault‑tolerant.

---

### 7️⃣ Object‑Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Classes, objects, attributes, methods
- Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction
- Class methods, static methods, properties
- Magic/dunder methods for Pythonic classes

**Goal:** Design maintainable, extensible systems with OOP.

---

### 8️⃣ Advanced Topics

- Decorators and higher‑order functions
- Generators and iterators
- Context managers and protocol methods
- Comprehensions and one‑liners
- Type hints and static checking basics

**Goal:** Write clean, expressive, and advanced Python code.

---

## 🏗️ Projects

The `09_Projects/` directory contains small, focused projects that integrate concepts from multiple modules, for example:

- CLI utilities
- File automation scripts
- API consumers
- Data processing mini‑tools

You can expand this section as you add more projects with brief descriptions in `09_Projects/README.md`.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started


### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
macOS / Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

### 3. Install Dependencies (If Required)


If there is no `requirements.txt` yet, you can add one later as advanced topics and projects use external libraries.

---

## 💻 How to Run

Run individual topic scripts by navigating into the desired folder:


Or run a project:


You can also open the project in VS Code or another IDE and run scripts from there.
